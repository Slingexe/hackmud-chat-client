# hackmud-chat-client
## Setup
Create a discord bot using [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
Create a discord server

Copy (or rename) the example config "configex.json" to "config.json"
Copy the bot's discord token to "DCTOKEN" (Application > Bot > Token)
Copy the application's clientID to "DCCLIENTID" (Application > OAuth > ClientID)
Copy the guildID to "DCGUILDID" (Turn on dev mode > Right Click guild > CopyID)

Run the BOT

In hackmud run the command chat_pass and copy the result
In discord send /auth password:"pass"
Once it says its successfully set the Token run /setup
The guild you have setup should now have 2 categorys (chat and tell) with channels you have joined being populated under chat and filled with messages :D (If message history doesn't show up leave and rejoin the chat ingame then try again.)
